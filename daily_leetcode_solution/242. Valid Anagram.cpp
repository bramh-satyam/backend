/*
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

This solution works when all the alphabets are lowercase(which is mentioned in the question as well). But if s and t will have spaces in them then this would break as when trying to update the value in letter_counter the index won't be in the arrays causing segmentation fault.

FIX: we can use unordered_map<char, int>, we will have to add special checks if the character is space or symbol(like comma or semi-colon, cause I think we can ignore it) while taking care of all the other special characters(maybe hindi literal or something).

BONUS: we can use "isalpha(c)" function to filter out only characters in case of this solution, taking care of all the non-ASCII characters. 

Edge Case:
1. string of un-even size: taken care
2. empty string: taken care

/*
BONUS: UNICODE INPUT

In the below given solution, we use "wstring" and "wchar_t" because of wide unicode characters, this solution also takes care of all the edge cases!

bool isAnagram(const std::wstring& s, const std::wstring& t){
    if(s.size() != t.size()){
        return false;
    }

    std::unordered_map<wchar_t, int> letter_counter;

    for(int index = 0; index < s.size(); index++)
    {
        letter_counter[s[index]]++;
        letter_counter[t[index]]--;
    }

    // this for loop works w/ C++17 and above
    for(const auto& [char, freq] : letter_counter)
    {
        if(freq != 0){
            return false;
        }
    }

    // this for loop works w/ C++11 and above
    for(const auto& item : letter_counter)
    {
        int count = item.second;
        if(count != 0){
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    return true;
