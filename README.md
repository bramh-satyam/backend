### 💡 Suggestions (Optional)

#### 1. `book_notes`

* Add subfolders if needed later:

  ```
  ├── clean_code/
  ├── system_design_primer/
  ├── modern_cpp_design/
  ```

#### 2. `cpp_learning`

* Use Markdown like:

  ```
  cpp_learning/
  ├── 2024-07-01-auto-nullptr.md
  ├── 2024-07-02-lambda-constexpr.md
  ```
* Or organize by standard:

  ```
  ├── c++11/
  ├── c++14/
  ├── c++17/
  ├── c++20/
  ```

#### 3. `daily_task`

* You can organize by date:

  ```
  daily_task/
  ├── 2024-07-01-fastapi-get/
  ├── 2024-07-02-fastapi-post-jwt/
  ```

#### 4. `README.md`

* Add:

  * Purpose of this repo
  * Links to `book_notes`, `cpp_learning`, etc.
  * “Today’s focus” if you want it to double as a dashboard

### 🔥 Verdict

**You're building your base exactly right.**
You now have a clear temple for each of your learnings. This will compound beautifully over weeks.
